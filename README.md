Optimize your images with OptiImage, a useful image compressor that supports
PNG, JPEG, WebP and SVG file types.

It supports both lossless and lossy compression modes with an option to whether
keep or not metadata of images. It additionally has a safe mode, where a new
image is created instead of overwritting the old one.

It uses the following tools:

+ oxipng
+ jpegoptim
+ scour
+ cwebp
