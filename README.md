Optimize your images with OptiImage, a useful image compressor that supports
PNG, JPEG, WebP and SVG file types.

It supports both lossless and lossy compression modes with an option to whether
keep or not metadata of images. It additionally has a safe mode, where a new
image is created instead of overwritting the old one.

It uses the following tools:

+ oxipng
+ jpegoptim
+ scour
+ cwebp

## Support

If you have an issue with OptiImage, please [open a support thread on KDE Discuss](https://discuss.kde.org/tag/optiimage). Alternatively, you ask in the [Plasma Mobile Matrix room](https://go.kde.org/matrix/#/#plasma-mobile:kde.org). See [Matrix](https://community.kde.org/Matrix) for more details.
